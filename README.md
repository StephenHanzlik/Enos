# Sunshine Daydream Back End
This is a new back end to compliment my first project in Galvanize.  This tool would extract snow pack data from federal SNOTEL stations and give me custody of the data rather than relying on the SNOTEL servers for historical data.  For more information on SNOTEL stations and how they collect data please see https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/about/mon_automate.html
