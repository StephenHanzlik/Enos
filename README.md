# Sunshine Daydream Back End
This is a new back end to compliment my first project in Galvanize which was a simple data visualiztion UI built with Angular JS and Material JS (http://sunshine-daydream.surge.sh/).  It has since sucumbed to issue due to lack of maintenance and a refactor is in order.  This tool would replace the API I was using and would extract snow pack data directly from federal SNOTEL stations.  This will give me custody of the data rather than relying on the SNOTEL servers for historical data.  A front end refactor is long over due as well and I have started one in react.  For more information on SNOTEL stations and how they collect data please see https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/about/mon_automate.html
